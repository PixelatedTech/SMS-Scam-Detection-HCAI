Detect. Classify. Understand.
This project builds an advanced multi-class SMS scam detection system that doesn't just flag suspicious messages — it tells you why.

A sharp rise in SMS scams demands a smarter defence.
This project delivers a multi-class scam detection system — fast, accurate, and explainable.

Messages are classified into: Ham (Safe), E-commerce Scam, Financial Scam, Crypto Scam, Phishing

Powered by Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, with LIME providing clear, human-readable explanations for every prediction.

Users can simply paste an SMS into the deployed Detectify platform. In seconds, the system reveals the scam type or ham with a breakdown of why the model made its decision.

Explainable AI brings full transparency to scam detection — no black boxes here.

Project Highlights:
- Trained multiple ML AND DL models with strong accuracy on real-world SMS datasets
- Deployed as a web app for easy public access
- Focused on user trust through transparent AI decisions
